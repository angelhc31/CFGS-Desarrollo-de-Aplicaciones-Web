# 📚 Notes, Resources, and Projects for the Higher Vocational Training in Web Application Development (DAW)

This repository contains all my notes, study materials, useful resources, and projects developed throughout the Higher Vocational Training Cycle in Web Application Development (DAW).

My goal with this repository is to have a well-organized collection of everything I have learned.

Besides all this material, I also have a large amount of paper-based material; not everything done or learned is reflected in this repository.
